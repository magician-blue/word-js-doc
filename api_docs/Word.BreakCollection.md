# Word.BreakCollection class

Package: [word](/en-us/javascript/api/word)

Note: This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.

Contains a collection of [Word.Break](/en-us/javascript/api/word/word.break) objects.

Extends
- [OfficeExtension.ClientObject](/en-us/javascript/api/office/officeextension.clientobject)

## Remarks

[ API set: WordApi BETA (PREVIEW ONLY) ](/en-us/javascript/api/requirement-sets/word/word-api-requirement-sets)

## Properties

- context  
  The request context associated with the object. This connects the add-in's process to the Office host application's process.

- items  
  Gets the loaded child items in this collection.

## Methods

- load(options)  
  Queues up a command to load the specified properties of the object. You must call `context.sync()` before reading the properties.

- load(propertyNames)  
  Queues up a command to load the specified properties of the object. You must call `context.sync()` before reading the properties.

- load(propertyNamesAndPaths)  
  Queues up a command to load the specified properties of the object. You must call `context.sync()` before reading the properties.

- toJSON()  
  Overrides the JavaScript `toJSON()` method in order to provide more useful output when an API object is passed to `JSON.stringify()`. (`JSON.stringify`, in turn, calls the `toJSON` method of the object that's passed to it.) Whereas the original `Word.BreakCollection` object is an API object, the `toJSON` method returns a plain JavaScript object (typed as `Word.Interfaces.BreakCollectionData`) that contains an "items" array with shallow copies of any loaded properties from the collection's items.

- track()  
  Track the object for automatic adjustment based on surrounding changes in the document. This call is a shorthand for [context.trackedObjects.add(thisObject)](/en-us/javascript/api/office/officeextension.clientrequestcontext#office-officeextension-clientrequestcontext-trackedobjects-member). If you're using this object across `.sync` calls and outside the sequential execution of a ".run" batch, and get an "InvalidObjectPath" error when setting a property or invoking a method on the object, you need to add the object to the tracked object collection when the object was first created. If this object is part of a collection, you should also track the parent collection.

- untrack()  
  Release the memory associated with this object, if it has previously been tracked. This call is shorthand for [context.trackedObjects.remove(thisObject)](/en-us/javascript/api/office/officeextension.clientrequestcontext#office-officeextension-clientrequestcontext-trackedobjects-member). Having many tracked objects slows down the host application, so please remember to free any objects you add, once you're done using them. You'll need to call `context.sync()` before the memory release takes effect.
