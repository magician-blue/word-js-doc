## Remarks

[API set: WordApi BETA (PREVIEW ONLY)](/en-us/javascript/api/requirement-sets/word/word-api-requirement-sets)

## Properties

- context  
  The request context associated with the object. This connects the add-in's process to the Office host application's process.

- isCited  
  Gets if the Source object has been cited in the document.

- tag  
  Gets the tag of the source.

- xml  
  Gets the XML representation of the source.

## Methods

- delete()  
  Deletes the Source object.

- getFieldByName(name)  
  Returns the value of a field in the bibliography Source object.

- load(options)  
  Queues up a command to load the specified properties of the object. You must call context.sync() before reading the properties.

- load(propertyNames)  
  Queues up a command to load the specified properties of the object. You must call context.sync() before reading the properties.

- load(propertyNamesAndPaths)  
  Queues up a command to load the specified properties of the object. You must call context.sync() before reading the properties.

- toJSON()  
  Overrides the JavaScript toJSON() method in order to provide more useful output when an API object is passed to JSON.stringify(). (JSON.stringify, in turn, calls the toJSON method of the object that's passed to it.) Whereas the original Word.Source object is an API object, the toJSON method returns a plain JavaScript object (typed as Word.Interfaces.SourceData) that contains shallow copies of any loaded child properties from the original object.

- track()  
  Track the object for automatic adjustment based on surrounding changes in the document. This call is a shorthand for context.trackedObjects.add(thisObject). If you're using this object across .sync calls and outside the sequential execution of a ".run" batch, and get an "InvalidObjectPath" error when setting a property or invoking a method on the object, you need to add the object to the tracked object collection when the object was first created. If this object is part of a collection, you should also track the parent collection.

- untrack()  
  Release the memory associated with t
